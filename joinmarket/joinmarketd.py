API
***

Taker code:
===========

Calling code must be prepared to act as both server and client, as the
communication is asynchronous both ways.

The typical Taker workflow for making use of this API will be:
1. Send message JM_INIT, which will set up the underlying
messaging connections (e.g. IRC). This will not cause an error if the Protocol
object is already inited.
2. Wait for the message JM_UP.
4. Send message JM_SETUP, passing N to indicate the number of counterparties
desired, and role TAKER.
3. Send the request JM_GET_OFFERS to retrieve, from the database maintained here,
a list of offers satisfying your requirements.
4. Do business logic in calling code to filter and select the offers you want
to fill.
Then, follow the protocol in 2 phases:
5. Prepare a taker commitment (using PoDLE by default) for your fill request.
6. Send message JM_FILL_OFFERS with the chosen offers and the taker's commitment data.
7. Wait for JM_FILL_ACCEPTED message, retrieve utxos and receiving addresses.
8. After validating the return data meets your needs (including the number of
counterparties responding), send request make_tx with a Bitcoin transaction
template constructed based on the data from 4.
9. Wait for JM_TX_ACCEPTED message, retrieve the signatures of your counterparties.
10. Fill in the signatures to your transaction template. Then, sign yourself and
broadcast the transaction if it meets all requirements.

A taker can go through this workflow more than once of course. Only get_offers is
stateless and can be called at any time, the other methods must be called in the
above sequence.

*******
METHODS
*******

 setup(role, N)

Start protocol instance.

ARGUMENTS:
arg1: role, must be "TAKER", other role not yet implemented.
arg2: number of potential maker counterparties
arg3: callback function which will be called on completion of on_fill_offers
arg4: callback function which will be called on completion of make_tx
RETURNS:
True or False if setup failed.


 fill_offers(amount, commitment, commitment_revelation, {nick1: oid1, nick2: oid2, ...})

Initiate phase 1 of the protocol.

ARGUMENTS:
arg1: amount of coinjoin in satoshis (0 for sweep),
arg3: commitment for request (type PoDLE by default)
arg4: revelation data for above commitment
arg5: dict representing counterparty nicks and their order ids. Must be length N.
RETURNS:
True if arguments valid, or False otherwise
CALLBACK on_fill_offers_response has arguments:
either error or:
{nick1: {'utxos':[list of utxos in hex], 'coinjoin_addr': addr1, 'change_addr': addr2},
nick2: {..}, .. }
Note that the list returned may be < N, up to consuming code to decide whether to
proceed with transaction with less than requested.


 make_tx(txhex, nicks):

Initiate phase 2 of the protocol.
Complete transaction negotiation, and get signatures. It is the calling code's
responsibility to ensure that the txhex satisfies *its own* spending rules (i.e.
that it receives enough to its own wallet), but also the calling code should
validate that the counterparties receive an amount in accordance with the rules
that they specified in their orders.

ARGUMENTS:
arg1: serialized transaction to be sent to counterparties
arg2: the list of counterparty nicks you choose to send the transaction to; it
must be a subset of the set that was *returned* by fill_offers()
RETURNS:
Serialized signed transaction or False if any failure occurred.

Additionally, these functions can be called statelessly (i.e. at any time):

 get_offers(amount)

Find offers available for the given coinjoin amount. The calling code
can take the returned dict of offers and apply its own business logic to filter
it before deciding who to include in the fill_offers call (see above).

ARGUMENTS:
arg1: amount in satoshis
RETURNS:
dict of available offers, format: [{'counterparty': nick1, 'ordertype': ot,
'oid': oid, 'minsize': x, 'txfee': t, 'maxsize': y, 'cjfee': f}, {},..]
